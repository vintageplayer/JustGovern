# Cross-Chain DAO Voting Using Moonbeam & LayerZero

Moonbean is EVM compatible and has a growing ecosystem of side-chains. on-chain DAO voting is good use leveraging benefits of both Moonbeam and LayerZero, and application with proven use rather than speculative demand.

The PDF contains initial take on the cross-chain dao governance architecture. It does not explicitly mention parameters well-defined in compound and OpenZeppling governor and TimeLock standards. Rather gives details on the cross-chain communication during voting and execution of governance actions.
